To know, Where we use the Sliding Window then we remember the following terms which is mentioned below:

Array, String, Sub Array, Sub String, Largest Sum, Maximum Sum, Minimum Sum

Algorithm:

Determine Window Size: Decide on a fixed window size that defines the number of elements to consider at each step.
Initialize and Process: Start with the initial elements within the window. Perform any initial calculations or operations.
Slide the Window: Iterate through the data, updating the window by adding the next element and removing the leftmost one.
Update and Evaluate: Adjust calculations or data structures based on the new element. Evaluate if the current window meets the problemâ€™s conditions.
Continue Sliding: Repeat the sliding, updating, and evaluation steps until the end of the data is reached.
Return Result: Return the final result or outcome based on the processed windows.
